# Twitter and Telegram bot

This is a simple alerting bot that will apply rules to filter messages on twitter and relay to an individual or channel.

Examples:

- If the railway company twitter account mentions your station or line between 6AM and 8AM, receive it on telegram, else ignore.
- If the police twitter account mentions your neighbourhood, receive the update on telegram
- If the bus company mention the service you get, receive the update

etc etc...
